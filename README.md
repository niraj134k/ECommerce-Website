A Modern E-Commerce Frontend

This project is a complete, responsive frontend for a modern e-commerce website. It is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and JavaScript. It operates entirely on the client-side, making it a lightweight and standalone demonstration of e-commerce UI and cart functionality.

The entire application is contained within a single ecommerce.html file.
